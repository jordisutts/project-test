# This is my first Markdown file 
###### it doesnt mean much

Paragraphs stay the same, no need for any p tags or page breaks as it automatically is read as a paragraph.

## This is a subheading

I used semantic ` <section>` tags instead of `<divs>`

```javascript
function multiplication(a,b);
if (typeof(a) == "number" && typeof(b) == "number") {
    return (a*b);
}
```
This is where any other interesting info may be written, but it may not.

### this is another smaller heading

*this is italic text*

**this is bold text**

**_this should be italic bold_**

### links and lists

if you want to create a link, then [here is a link to google](https://www.google.com)

* this is an unordered list item
* so is this
* and this

1. this is an ordered list
2. this will be numbered
3. so will this
    3.this is a subpoint
    4. as is this
